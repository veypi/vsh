## 1. Purpose

`vsh` is a deterministic, policy-controlled, sandbox-only, bash-like runtime for AI agents.

It preserves the product idea behind Vercel's `just-bash` while making different implementation choices:

- shell semantics are owned in-tree, with public parser/AST and expansion packages under `shell/`
- filesystem access is virtualized by default
- commands are implemented in Go and resolved through an explicit registry
- unknown commands never fall through to the host OS
- sandbox policy is part of the core runtime, not an optional mode

The target is not "Bash in Go". The target is a practical shell-shaped runtime for agentic coding and data workflows that must be deterministic, inspectable, and safe by default.

## 2. Product Definition

`vsh` is a shell runtime with the following product contract:

- it accepts shell-like scripts and command snippets
- it evaluates a pragmatic subset of shell semantics
- it runs entirely inside a sandboxed runtime
- it can expose structured traces and lifecycle logs for agent debugging and orchestration when the embedder opts in
- it uses a virtual filesystem unless a caller explicitly installs another sandboxed backend
- it never executes unknown commands on the host

The runtime is optimized for LLM and agent workloads:

- file inspection and transformation
- grep-like and ripgrep-style content search
- CSV inspection and reshaping via registry-backed tooling such as `xan`
- directory traversal
- data reshaping pipelines
- persistent multi-step agent sessions
- deterministic replay in tests
- policy-aware execution in long-running agent systems

## 3. Goals

1. Port the `just-bash` concept to a Go-native runtime named `vsh`.
2. Keep shell semantics, control flow, and interpreter behavior inside the project-owned shell core while exposing only the small public packages we intentionally support.
3. Support only sandbox mode.
4. Use explicit Go command implementations instead of host subprocesses.
5. Default to an in-memory or otherwise virtualized filesystem.
6. Expose deterministic observability hooks and execution results suitable for agent frameworks.
7. Keep the implementation small, explicit, and easy to reason about.

## 4. Non-Goals

`vsh` will not:

- implement full GNU Bash behavior
- provide job control, readline-style history navigation/editing, or host TTY emulation
- support host subprocess passthrough
- support a user-facing compatibility mode as part of the default runtime contract
- default to the host filesystem
- silently emulate missing commands with host binaries
- optimize for human shell convenience over agent determinism

## 5. Design Principles

### 5.1 Sandbox-only is a product decision

There is no runtime mode where command execution falls back to `exec.Command`, `/bin/sh`, or `/bin/bash`. Unknown commands return a clear shell-style failure, typically exit status `127`.

### 5.2 The shell core owns shell semantics

We do not reimplement parsing, quoting, command substitution, loops, or shell AST traversal from scratch during execution. Those responsibilities stay inside the in-tree shell packages under `internal/shell`.

The supported public shell semantics packages are `shell/syntax`, `shell/syntax/typedjson`, `shell/expand`, and `shell/analysis`. The interpreter remains internal as `internal/shell/interp`, and `internal/runtime` only calls the concrete `internal/shell` entrypoints.

`shell/syntax` and `shell/expand` are supported for external consumers that need the parser, AST, typed JSON encoding, expansion rules, and expansion-visible value types. `shell/syntax` preserves here-document delimiter metadata together with the final closer-candidate metadata needed to inspect matched closers, EOF termination, `<<-` tab-stripping results, and non-prefix closer candidates such as indented, later-in-line, or quote-mismatched raw tokens. The public heredoc metadata includes both full closer-line capture and token-level candidate details when a final candidate token is recognized. The public pattern AST includes wildcard nodes, extglob alternation, and grouped alternation via `PatternGroup` so `case` arms and `[[ == ]]` consumers can inspect shell pattern structure without reparsing raw text. `IfClause` nodes also expose explicit branch-kind metadata for `if`, `elif`, and `else` tokens so analyzers do not need to rescan source text at `Position` to distinguish nested branches. `shell/syntax.ParseError` remains the public parser diagnostic surface: text formatting via `Error()` and `BashError()` is preserved, and typed metadata such as `Kind`, `Construct`, `Unexpected`, `Expected`, and `IsRecoverable` is exposed so callers do not need to parse diagnostic strings; pattern-context failures use `Construct=pattern` so analyzers can distinguish them from generic token errors. `shell/syntax` also includes parse-fidelity helpers on AST nodes such as `Word`, `Pattern`, and `CallExpr` for exact raw source, unquoted text, quote-presence checks, and simple-command operand separator metadata; exact raw text and operand-separator fidelity are only guaranteed on nodes built directly by `Parse`, while synthetic or typedjson-decoded trees fall back to AST-derived behavior without preserving original source bytes. For surface forms that downstream analyzers must match exactly, `shell/syntax` also exposes stable structured trivia such as leading command-word backslash escapes, assignment operator/value boundaries, backquote-closing backslash runs, and optional command-substitution diagnostic-end metadata so callers do not need to rescan `RawText()` for those spellings. `shell/analysis` is the supported read-only analysis hook surface for external analysis and static-tooling consumers. It delivers immutable semantic events for run/file boundaries, statements, commands, scope changes, variable reads and writes, unsets, and selected option changes.

For surface forms that downstream analyzers must match exactly, `shell/syntax` also exposes stable structured trivia such as leading command-word backslash escapes, assignment operator/value boundaries, backquote-closing backslash runs, and optional command-substitution diagnostic-end metadata so callers do not need to rescan `RawText()` for those spellings. `shell/analysis` is the supported read-only analysis hook surface for external analysis and static-tooling consumers. It delivers immutable semantic events for run/file boundaries, statements, commands, scope changes, variable reads and writes, unsets, and selected option changes.

The public `shell/syntax` parse-diagnostic surface includes structured metadata for variant-gated syntax rejections. `syntax.LangError.FeatureID`, `FeatureSubtype`, `FeatureDetail`, `FeatureID.Category()`, and the `Pos`/optional exclusive `End` trigger span are the stable machine-readable surface for analyzers and lint tools; the legacy free-form `Feature` text remains for compatibility and should not be used as the primary matching key. `FeatureSubtype` refines exact surface forms within a feature family, and `FeatureDetail` carries any associated stable operator, flag text, or delimiter detail when the parser can expose it without changing legacy error text. Variant-gated parameter-expansion prefix families should report dedicated feature IDs when the parser can identify them, including zsh `${~name}` glob-substitution prefixes.

`shell/analysis` is intentionally read-only. It does not expose interpreter mutation primitives, completion backends, host execution internals, or other unrelated runtime concerns. Helper packages such as `shell/internal/pattern`, the interpreter, and shell file utilities remain internal implementation detail rather than supported public API.

The shell core also owns shell-variant-aware stack introspection state. Bash namespaced state such as `BASH_SOURCE`, `BASH_LINENO`, `BASH_EXECUTION_STRING`, `FUNCNAME`, `caller`, sourced-file provenance, and top-level file-backed `$0` semantics are tracked inside the in-tree interpreter rather than synthesized in a shell prelude. That namespace is part of the resolved shell profile: it is exposed for `bash` and `bats`, and stays unset for `sh`, `mksh`, and `zsh`.

The shell core also owns trap and signal semantics. `trap`, pseudo-signals such as `EXIT`, `ERR`, `DEBUG`, and `RETURN`, real-signal registration and printing, subshell trap inheritance rules, and shell-visible signal routing for `kill $$`, `kill $BASHPID`, and background-job targets are implemented in the in-tree interpreter rather than delegated to host process behavior. Catchable host signals such as Ctrl-C are bridged into the active foreground shell family through runtime-owned signal handlers, while non-catchable signals and job control remain outside the product contract. Failed pipelines are part of that contract: `ERR` is evaluated once per failed pipeline after the final pipeline status and `PIPESTATUS` array have been established, rather than once per failing component.

The shell core compiles user input as a sequence of complete parsed chunks before execution. In non-interactive `Run`, the core incrementally reparses the growing script buffer so parse-time state such as aliases and `shopt` flags can affect later commands in the same execution. Each complete chunk then goes through the same validation, budget checks, pipeline rewriting, and loop instrumentation before the runner sees that chunk's AST.

The shell core may also apply small AST normalizations when the in-tree parser or interpreter behavior diverges from the Bash semantics we intend to preserve. One example is wrapping the right-hand side of pipelines in synthetic subshells so default parent-shell state matches Bash's `lastpipe=off` behavior while still allowing the interpreter to unwrap those specific synthetic wrappers when `shopt -s lastpipe` is enabled.

Process substitution is supported as a sandbox-native shell feature. The shell core must provision runtime-owned opaque pipe paths under the sandbox namespace and must not rely on host FIFOs, host-visible `TMPDIR` paths, or host path semantics to implement `<(...)` and `>(...)`.

Shell selection is also owned by the shell core. `ExecutionRequest.ShellVariant`, `InteractiveRequest.ShellVariant`, nested `Invocation.Exec` / `Invocation.Interact` requests, and server `session.exec.shell_variant` all feed one resolved shell variant for parse, expand, and interpret behavior. Resolution precedence is: explicit `ShellVariant` when it is not `auto`, then `Interpreter` basename when it names a supported shell, then the top-level script shebang, then default `bash`. `Interpreter` remains the presentation and argv0 field; it does not by itself define parser behavior once a concrete `ShellVariant` is present.

Supported resolved variants are `bash`, `sh`, `mksh`, `zsh`, and `bats`. The shell core resolves one internal shell profile from that variant and uses it as the single source of truth for parser language, parse-diagnostic style, legacy parser compatibility switches, default POSIX mode, default brace expansion, Bash-namespaced special-variable exposure, and audited builtin-family availability.

Current resolved runtime profiles are:

- `bash`: Bash parsing and Bash-style diagnostics, POSIX mode off by default, brace expansion on, Bash namespace exposed.
- `sh`: POSIX parsing and POSIX-style diagnostics, POSIX mode on by default, brace expansion off, Bash namespace hidden.
- `mksh`: mksh parsing and mksh-style diagnostics, current non-POSIX runtime defaults for unaudited switches, Bash namespace hidden.
- `zsh`: zsh parsing and zsh-style diagnostics, current non-POSIX runtime defaults for unaudited switches, Bash namespace hidden.
- `bats`: Bats parsing with the same runtime surface as `bash`, including the Bash namespace, but `@test` execution and `#!/bin/bats` dispatch must still fail explicitly with a clear bats-runner-not-implemented error rather than silently falling back to Bash semantics.

Audited builtin families are also part of that shell profile. `caller`, `compgen`, `complete`, `compopt`, `mapfile`, `readarray`, and `shopt` are only supported in `bash` and `bats`. `dirs`, `pushd`, and `popd` are only supported in `bash` and `zsh`. `declare`, `local`, `typeset`, `source`, `enable`, and `type` remain shared in this phase. Variant-inactive builtins are unsupported rather than merely disabled: command lookup, `type`, programmable completion, `help`, and `enable -a` must not present them as active for a shell that does not support them.

The shell builtin `printf` remains a Bash compatibility boundary: numeric conversions must accept quoted character constants such as `"'A"` and `"\"B"`, `%q` and `${var@Q}` must emit Bash-compatible shell-escaped strings, `%b` and bare format-string escapes must honor Bash's escape decoding rules, `%(... )T` must consult only exported `TZ`, and write failures must still surface shell status `1` after any partial output or diagnostics.

The registry-backed `/bin/printf` command is a GNU/coreutils compatibility boundary instead. It must follow GNU operand parsing and diagnostics, use GNU `%q` shell quoting and escape handling, reject Bash-only `%(... )T`, and not implement the shell builtin's `-v` assignment mode. `--help` and `--version` remain outside this compatibility scope for now.

Shell builtins that remain implemented inside the in-tree interpreter should preserve the Bash-facing option contracts we depend on for conformance. Current requirements include Bash-compatible `type` resolution and reporting for `-a`, `-f`, `-p`, `-P`, and `-t` across aliases, functions, builtins, keywords, and PATH files; Bash-compatible `enable` support for the real in-tree runner builtins, including `-n`, `-p`, `-a`, `-s`, and disabled-builtin effects on lookup and `builtin` dispatch; `ulimit -a` reporting that writes through the shell's redirected stdout and fails the command when that write fails; plus Bash-compatible `set -C` / `set +C`, `set -o noclobber` / `set +o noclobber`, and `set -o posix` / `set +o posix` handling. Disabled builtins must disappear from `compgen -A command` unless a PATH command of the same name exists, while `compgen -A builtin`, `compgen -A helptopic`, and default `help` output must continue to advertise them as disabled rather than absent. In POSIX mode, direct POSIX special builtins must outrank shell functions during command lookup, report as builtins via `type`, and keep prefix assignments in the current shell rather than treating them as temporary exported command variables; disabling one with `enable -n` must remove that special-builtin behavior until it is re-enabled.

### 5.3 Project-owned boundaries

The runtime owns:

- filesystem abstraction
- host platform identity, process metadata, and pipe semantics
- command registry
- policy enforcement
- output limiting
- tracing
- execution result normalization

### 5.4 Determinism over compatibility

When Bash compatibility conflicts with deterministic, inspectable behavior for agents, we choose the deterministic option.

### 5.5 Small explicit surfaces

Every major subsystem should have a narrow interface. Callers should be able to replace the filesystem backend, registry, or observability callbacks without understanding shell implementation internals.

## 6. Runtime Architecture

The runtime is composed of five layers:

1. public `shell/syntax` parser/AST and `shell/expand` semantics packages
2. project-owned shell core and internal interpreter orchestration
3. sandboxed project-owned filesystem abstraction
4. Go command registry
5. policy and trace layers

Execution flow:

1. Parse the script with `syntax.Parser`, incrementally when shell state like aliases must affect later complete commands in the same execution.
2. Construct an execution context from the current session with:
   - session-owned virtual filesystem
   - configured host adapter for platform identity, process metadata, and pipes
   - command registry
   - policy
   - optional read-only `shell/analysis` observer
   - optional trace recorder and logging callbacks
   - bounded stdout/stderr capture
3. Configure `interp.Runner` with project handlers for:
   - file open
   - stat
   - readdir
   - simple-call interception
   - command execution
4. Run each compiled chunk in order on one `interp.Runner`, preserving shell state across chunks.
5. Normalize shell/interpreter errors into an `ExecutionResult`.
6. Return stdout, stderr, exit code, and structured trace events when tracing is enabled.

The CLI also provides a minimal interactive shell mode. That mode is a front-end over the same runtime, not a second execution engine:

- it keeps one `Session` alive for the duration of the interactive shell
- it uses `syntax.Parser.InteractiveSeq` to gather complete interactive statements and continuation prompts
- it executes each completed entry via `Session.Exec`, using the same runner-backed parser construction that feeds live alias state into parse-time expansion
- it carries forward the virtual cwd and shell-visible variable state between entries at the CLI layer
- it may expose session-local command history via the `history` command, with entries stored in `BASH_HISTORY`
- it supports programmable completion state via the `complete`, `compgen`, and `compopt` shell builtins; bare calls plus `builtin ...` and `command ...` dispatch resolve to those shell builtins, while `/bin/complete`, `/bin/compgen`, and `/bin/compopt` expose the same shared completion logic as command wrappers; the shipped CLI still does not provide a readline/tab-completion frontend

The normal CLI entrypoint also accepts filesystem selection flags before the shell arguments:

- `vsh --root <dir> ...` mounts `<dir>` read-only at `/home/agent/project` with an in-memory writable overlay
- `vsh --cwd <dir> ...` sets the initial sandbox working directory
- `vsh --readwrite-root <dir> ...` mounts `<dir>` as sandbox `/` so writes persist back to the host, but only when `<dir>` is inside the system temp directory
- `vsh --inherit-env <vars> ...` copies the named host environment variables into the runtime base environment without otherwise widening the default environment surface; the value is a comma-separated list of shell variable names
- `vsh --copy-script ...` stages the positional host regular file into the sandbox before execution instead of requiring it to already exist in the sandbox namespace
- `vsh --json ...` emits one JSON object for a non-interactive execution with `stdout`, `stderr`, `exitCode`, truncation flags, timing metadata, and optional trace metadata when tracing is enabled
- `vsh --dump-ast ...` parses the selected non-interactive input and writes the typed JSON `shell/syntax` AST to stdout without executing the script
- `vsh --dump-ast --detect ...` chooses the AST parser variant from a leading shebang first, then a positional file extension for file-backed inputs, and otherwise falls back to `bash`; `--detect` is not a standalone reporting mode
- `vsh --server --socket <path>` serves a long-lived JSON-RPC protocol over a Unix domain socket instead of executing a script
- `vsh --server --listen <host:port>` serves the same protocol over an explicit loopback TCP listener instead of executing a script
- `vsh --session-ttl <duration>` controls how long idle server sessions survive without active work
- when `--cwd` is omitted, `--root` starts at `/home/agent/project` and `--readwrite-root` starts at `/`
- when a positional script path is supplied, the CLI resolves and reads it from the configured sandbox filesystem relative to the sandbox working directory, preserving the argv path exactly as provided
- when that positional script path is an absolute host path underneath `--root` or `--readwrite-root`, the CLI rewrites it to the corresponding sandbox path before execution instead of reading the host file directly
- otherwise, the CLI does not read host files directly by positional path unless the caller explicitly opts into staging with `--copy-script`

External test harnesses should use the normal CLI entrypoint together with the filesystem selection flags above. In particular, GNU-style wrapper scripts may invoke `vsh --readwrite-root <tempdir> --cwd <dir> --inherit-env LC_ALL,LC_CTYPE,LANG,LANGUAGE -c 'exec "$@"' _ <utility> ...` so the harness exercises the same shell and runtime path as normal `vsh` execution while still opting into the locale variables those suites require.

That frontend is also exposed as a public `cli` package so shipped binaries can reuse the same flag parsing, version rendering, interactive behavior, JSON result rendering, and runtime setup:

- `cmd/vsh` is a thin wrapper over `github.com/veypi/vsh/cli`
- `contrib/extras/cmd/vsh-extras` is a thin wrapper over the same package with `contrib/extras` pre-registered into the runtime
- `github.com/veypi/vsh/server` is the shared public server surface used by both wrapper binaries to host the same session protocol over Unix sockets or caller-provided listeners

### 6.1 Session model

`vsh` should expose a long-lived session abstraction.

- `Runtime` is a factory for configured sessions
- `Runtime.Run` is a one-shot convenience that creates a fresh session and discards it after execution
- `Session` owns the filesystem instance, command registry, policy, base environment, and default working directory
- `Session` also owns a runtime-managed virtual wall clock used for user-visible timekeeping inside the sandbox
- each `Exec` call creates a fresh `interp.Runner`
- shell-local variables, shell functions, and option state are per-execution by default
- programmable completion specs created by `complete` and modified by `compopt` are runner-local shell state shared by the shell builtins and the `/bin/complete` and `/bin/compopt` wrappers: they persist within one `Exec` call and within an interactive shell session, but not across separate `Session.Exec` calls
- filesystem state persists across executions within the same session
- the virtual wall clock persists across executions within the same session and is observable by time-based builtins such as `date`, `touch`, `uptime`, `who`, `ls`, and shell `printf %(... )T`
- `date --set` and the legacy `date MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]` form mutate only that session-local virtual wall clock; they never modify the host clock
- integrations may inspect the session's effective policy limits when they need to align frontend staging or preflight behavior with runtime-enforced caps such as `MaxFileBytes`

This matches the agent workflow we care about: a sequence of shell calls operating on a shared sandboxed workspace, without requiring shell-local state to leak between calls unless we explicitly add that feature later.

### 6.2 Server mode

`vsh` should also expose a local-first server mode for hosts that want a long-lived control endpoint instead of direct in-process method calls.

- the server protocol is JSON-RPC 2.0 over either a Unix domain socket or a caller-provided listener such as loopback TCP
- the protocol is JSON-RPC 2.0 request/response, not a custom streaming transport
- the shared CLI requires exactly one transport flag: `--socket` or `--listen`
- the shared CLI restricts `--listen` to loopback hosts because v1 has no authentication layer
- the Unix socket helper must chmod the socket to `0600`, reject an already-active socket path, and only replace stale socket files
- `session_id` maps 1:1 to a persistent `Session`
- filesystem shape is configured once at server startup through the normal runtime options and is not part of the wire protocol
- the primary remote operation is `session.exec`, which runs one non-interactive `Session.Exec` call and returns the full execution result in one response
- multiple sessions may be active concurrently across multiple client connections
- a single session permits at most one active `session.exec` call at a time because `Session.Exec` is serialized
- clients are expected to reconnect or open a second socket when they need concurrent requests; v1 does not require multiplexed event streams on one connection

Recommended v1 methods:

- `system.hello`, `system.ping`
- `session.create`, `session.get`, `session.list`, `session.destroy`
- `session.exec`

Recommended v1 result shape for `session.exec`:

- `exit_code`, `stdout`, `stderr`
- `stdout_truncated`, `stderr_truncated`
- `final_env`, `shell_exited`, `control_stderr`
- timing metadata such as `started_at`, `finished_at`, and `duration_ms`
- the updated session summary

Recommended v1 `session.exec` params include:

- `session_id`
- `script`
- optional `shell_variant` with values `auto`, `bash`, `sh`, `mksh`, `zsh`, or `bats`
- optional argv/env/working-directory fields matching `ExecutionRequest`

Recommended v1 non-goals:

- interactive shell streaming over the protocol
- attach/detach and replay buffers
- filesystem RPC
- PTY resize and host TTY emulation
- signal forwarding and job control
- restart-persistent sessions

### 6.3 Default sandbox layout

The default in-memory sandbox should look Unix-like enough for agent scripts:

- `/home/agent` as the default home and working directory
- `/tmp` for scratch files, created with sticky-bit semantics
- `/dev` as a small runtime-owned device namespace
- `/dev/null` as a character device that always reads EOF and discards writes
- `/dev/urandom` as a character device that yields a deterministic pseudo-random byte stream and discards writes
- `/dev/zero` as a character device that yields zero bytes on reads and discards writes
- `/bin` and `/usr/bin` as virtual command locations
- deterministic identity defaults via `USER=agent`, `LOGNAME=agent`, `GROUP=agent`, `GROUPS=1000`, `UID=1000`, `EUID=1000`, `GID=1000`, and `EGID=1000`

Commands remain registry-backed Go implementations. `/bin/ls` and similar paths are virtual command identities, not host executables.

Ownership name resolution for commands such as `ls`, `chown`, and `chgrp` must come from those runtime identity defaults plus sandbox-visible `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` data when present. The runtime must not consult host account databases outside the sandbox contract.

Programmable user completion follows the same boundary: `compgen -A user` may use `USER` plus sandbox-visible `/etc/passwd`, but it must not read host account databases outside the sandbox contract.

The runtime owns the reserved `/dev` entries rather than relying on each filesystem backend to create backend-specific stand-ins. Additional `/dev/*` paths may exist when tests or callers seed them, but only runtime-defined entries such as `/dev/null`, `/dev/urandom`, and `/dev/zero` are guaranteed by default.

The shell initializes shell-owned startup state rather than inheriting host defaults. When callers omit them, the runner must synthesize `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`, exported `PWD` matching the virtual working directory, `PS4="+ "`, the default `IFS`, readonly `SHELLOPTS`, and `SHELL=/bin/sh`; `HISTFILE` is only initialized for interactive shells. `HOME` is not synthesized by the shell, so an execution with a cleared environment still observes `HOME` as unset unless the caller explicitly provides it.

The runtime treats the runner's virtual directory plus shell-visible `PWD` as the authoritative working-directory state. Shell variable assignments, shell-owned startup state, `BASH_HISTORY`, variant-exposed `BASH_EXECUTION_STRING`, and `VSH_UMASK` are synchronized by direct runner mutation APIs rather than by prepending trusted shell code, so syntax errors, traces, and variant-exposed stack variables always use real user line numbers.

Sandbox-facing machine metadata is also runtime-owned: `HOSTNAME`, `hostname`, `OSTYPE`, variant-exposed `BASHPID`, and `PPID` must resolve from sandbox metadata and runner state rather than from host uname or host process inspection.

That metadata now has a supported public adapter boundary. `vsh.Config.Host` and `vsh.WithHost(host.Adapter)` select the logical host implementation, while the public `host` package owns typed platform identity, per-execution PID/PPID/process-group seeds, and the pipe primitive used for pipelines and process substitution. The default adapter remains internal and virtual so zero-config sandbox behavior stays unchanged.

Signal identity is part of that runtime-owned metadata. Stable `$$` values, per-shell `BASHPID`, shell-family `PPID`, virtual background job IDs, and internal signal delivery for shell-managed `kill` targets must be derived from runner state rather than host PIDs.

Package responsibilities:

- `host/`: public adapter contract for host-derived defaults, logical platform semantics, per-execution process metadata, and pipe provisioning
- `cli/`: reusable CLI frontend that parses shell flags, renders help/version output, handles interactive mode, and provisions runtimes for thin wrapper binaries
- `server/`: public shared server implementation that owns JSON-RPC framing and session registries for both shipped CLIs and external hosts, plus Unix-socket listener helpers
- `shell/analysis/`: supported public read-only semantic observer surface for external analysis and static tooling; no mutation primitives or host execution details are exposed here
- `shell/expand/`: supported public shell expansion semantics, public environment/value interfaces, and expansion error types
- `shell/syntax/`: supported public shell parser, AST, and typed JSON tree encoding under `shell/syntax/typedjson`
- `internal/runtime/`: internal runtime/session creation, run configuration, result collection, output capture
- `internal/shell/`: concrete shell core entrypoints plus the internal interpreter integration; no product policy lives here
- `fs/`: POSIX-like path normalization, memory filesystem, host-backed lower layers, overlay, and snapshot backends
- `network/`: runtime-owned HTTP sandbox with origin- and path-boundary-aware allowlists, method controls, redirect revalidation, and response-size limits
- `commands/`: registry and Go-native command implementations such as `clear`, `compadjust`, `complete`, `compgen`, `compopt`, `echo`, `egrep`, `fgrep`, `grep`, `history`, `ls`, `mkfifo`, `pwd`, `rg`, `strings`, and `xan`
- `contrib/`: opt-in command modules and public helper packages that stay outside the root module dependency graph so heavyweight helpers do not inflate the core runtime. The repository may also expose umbrella contrib helpers such as `contrib/extras` to register the stable official contrib command set without changing the default runtime surface, may ship reusable tool/helper packages such as `contrib/bashtool` and `contrib/codingtools`, and may ship official opt-in binaries such as `contrib/extras/cmd/vsh-extras` from the corresponding contrib module. Current command examples include `awk`, `html-to-markdown`, `jq`, `nodejs`, `python`, `sqlite3`, and `yq`.
- `packages/`: publishable JavaScript and TypeScript packages. `packages/vsh-wasm` owns the `js/wasm` assets plus explicit host entrypoints such as `@ewhauser/vsh-wasm/browser` and `@ewhauser/vsh-wasm/node`.
- `policy/`: allowlists, root restrictions, size limits, network stance, and decision helpers
- `trace/`: event schema, recorder interfaces, and in-memory buffering
- `examples/`: runnable demos that can depend on external SDKs without affecting the root module build list. The repository may also ship official maintained examples such as `examples/vsh-eval`; any evaluator-only commands or affordances used there, including scripted-tool discovery/help shims, remain local to the example and do not expand the core runtime contract.
- `tests/`: black-box runtime tests and corpus-driven shell fixtures

We intentionally do not create a `compat/` package because external harness support should ride on the normal CLI and runtime surfaces, not a second execution API.

The repository itself should be maintained as a committed Go workspace plus a pnpm workspace. The root module stays focused on the runtime, CLI, and core commands, while direct children under `contrib/` are separate modules for optional heavyweight commands and public helper packages, `packages/` contains publishable JavaScript packages, and `examples/` is a separate module used for demos that may need external SDK dependencies or looser version pinning. Official examples can include repo-maintained evaluation harnesses or SDK integrations, but any example-specific helpers stay scoped to that example module rather than silently becoming supported runtime surface.

Top-level repository directories such as `cmd/`, `contrib/`, `packages/`,
`scripts/`, and `third_party/` may also carry doc-only package comments so
pkg.go.dev can render repository layout pages and directory synopses. Those
overview packages are for navigation and documentation only; supported Go APIs
remain the concrete runtime packages and documented nested modules.

Optional language runtimes in `contrib/` must preserve the same sandbox contract as core commands. The current `contrib/nodejs` design is experimental and intentionally excluded from `contrib/extras` until its surface stabilizes. It uses `goja` plus a curated `goja_nodejs` allowlist, with vsh-owned replacements for host-sensitive modules such as `process`, `console`, `fs`, and `path`. It does not expose host subprocesses, host filesystem access, or unrestricted network APIs, and any supported file access must flow through `Invocation.FS`.

The stable contrib bundle also includes `contrib/python`, which registers both `python` and `python3` via `gomonty`. That command remains outside `vsh.DefaultRegistry()`, but when it is explicitly registered or pulled in through `contrib/extras`, filesystem access must continue to flow through `Invocation.FS`, environment access through `Invocation.Env`, and execution must remain sandbox-local without host subprocess escape hatches. With the pinned `gomonty`/Monty runtime, builtin `print(...)` output must be forwarded to vsh stdout, while upstream Monty still treats `print(..., file=...)` as unsupported. Invoking `python` or `python3` with no arguments on a tty should start an in-process Monty REPL; the same zero-argument form on non-tty stdin should continue to execute the full stdin stream as a script. When interactive commands need terminal reopening semantics, they must do so through a runtime-owned sandbox `/dev/tty` endpoint rather than by receiving raw host tty handles in `Invocation`.

The opt-in `contrib/awk` module must preserve the same sandbox boundary while matching GNU awk behavior inside that boundary. Its GNU-style source loading (`-f`, `-e`, `-E`, `-i`), `getline`/redirection file access, and `system()` plus pipe operators must all route through runtime-owned capabilities: file reads and writes through `Invocation.FS`, and shell execution through nested `Invocation.Exec` requests using `sh` semantics in the same session, cwd, environment, and policy context. The contrib awk adapter and its vendored interpreter fork may expose hook points for sandbox-owned file writers and shell runners, but they must not bypass the runtime by calling host `os.OpenFile`, `exec.Command`, or equivalent host-global process APIs directly for awk program I/O or command execution.

The command-facing `Invocation` is capability-only. Custom commands get sandboxed filesystem and fetch helpers plus nested execution and limits metadata, but they do not receive the raw policy object, raw trace recorder, raw network client, or raw host tty handles. Policy checks and file-access tracing happen behind `Invocation.FS`, `Invocation.Fetch` is nil unless network access is configured, and interactive terminal reopening is mediated by the runtime-owned `/dev/tty` device inside the sandbox namespace.

The command-facing `Invocation` also exposes runtime-owned wall-clock helpers. `Invocation.Now()` returns the current session clock and `Invocation.SetTime(time.Time)` updates it when the runtime supports mutation. The default runtime wires these helpers to the session-local virtual wall clock described above, so time-sensitive builtins stay deterministic and sandbox-scoped without exposing host clock mutation.

Registry semantics are override-friendly: later registrations replace earlier ones so embedders can swap in custom implementations for built-ins, and `RegisterLazy` defers expensive command setup until first execution while still participating in `PATH` resolution and `Names()`.

Key design decisions:

- `Runtime` is a concrete type. Callers should not need to mock it.
- `New` should accept composable runtime options, with helpers such as `WithRegistry`, `WithFileSystem`, `WithWorkspace`, `WithNetwork`, `WithHTTPAccess`, and `WithConfig` for callers that prefer either direct options or an existing `Config` value.
- `Session` is the primary unit of agent interaction.
- `FileSystem` is narrow and POSIX-shaped.
- filesystem state persists at the session level; shell-local state does not persist across executions by default
- `ReplaceEnv` starts from an empty per-execution environment instead of the session base environment
- `FinalEnv` reports the shell-visible variable state at the end of one execution and does not mutate the session base environment
- `ShellExited` reports that the execution invoked shell termination, such as the `exit` builtin; interactive front-ends should stop when it is true
- command implementations receive project context through `Invocation`, not through globals
- commands that need sub-execution should use the injected `Invocation.Exec` callback rather than reaching around the runtime
- `Invocation.Exec` inherits the current command environment and virtual working directory by default while staying inside the same session and policy boundary
- `Invocation.Exec` supports two non-interactive modes: `Script` for nested shell execution and `Command` for already-tokenized argv execution without shell parsing
- `Script` and `Command` are mutually exclusive; `Args` applies to script mode positional parameters
- direct filesystem and text-processing commands should prefer `Invocation.FS` over nested shell execution
- commands that need whole-input reads should use `commands.ReadAll`, `commands.ReadAllStdin`, or `Invocation.FS.ReadFile` so `MaxFileBytes` and diagnostic behavior stay consistent
- orchestration-style commands such as `xargs`, `find -exec`, and shell-wrapper helpers should use `Invocation.Exec`
- policy is an explicit interface so embedders can swap simple allowlists for richer policy engines later

## 9. Shell Core Integration Plan

### 9.1 Compile pipeline

`internal/shell` owns one compile pipeline shared by interactive and non-interactive execution.

For script execution, that pipeline:

1. parses the request text into a `*syntax.File`
2. validates unsupported constructs such as descriptor-dup redirections that would otherwise panic the interpreter
3. checks command-substitution depth and accumulates glob-operation budgets as parsed chunks enter the compile pipeline
4. rewrites pipeline right-hand sides into synthetic subshells where needed to preserve default `lastpipe=off` behavior
5. instruments loop guards for `MaxLoopIterations`

The runtime request boundary carries only script text or tokenized command input. Parsing is a private shell-core concern.

### 9.2 Runner construction

For each execution, build a fresh `interp.Runner` through one shell-owned constructor path rather than ad hoc option hooks or split config layers.

That runner construction path carries:

- explicit environment and virtual directory
- stdio, startup options, positional parameters, and interactive mode
- the configured read-only `shell/analysis` observer, if any
- call and exec handlers
- file, stat, readdir, realpath, and process-substitution handlers

Per-run metadata such as the top-level script path for file-backed `$0`/`main` stack frames and synthetic pipeline metadata for `lastpipe` is applied through one shell-owned run-preparation path.

The runtime never inherits the host process environment by default, and the command execution path never falls through to host subprocess execution.

The supported analysis integration point is `shell/analysis` plus `vsh.WithAnalysisObserver` / `vsh.Config.AnalysisObserver`. The observer surface is runtime-level only, read-only, and durable by design. Interpreter internals, `internal/shell/interp`, and unrelated helpers such as `internal/shell/fileutil` remain internal.

Implementation detail for the current runtime:

- the runner's virtual directory is authoritative for filesystem behavior
- shell-visible `PWD` may differ from the cleaned virtual directory when a visible logical path is still valid
- the runner reset path initializes shell-owned startup variables (`PATH`, exported `PWD`, `PS4`, `IFS`, `SHELLOPTS`, `SHELL`, and interactive `HISTFILE`) while preserving an unset `HOME` when the execution environment omits it
- `let` is handled natively by the in-tree `syntax.LetClause` AST node
- all project path handlers resolve relative paths from virtual `PWD`, not from host cwd
- the in-tree runner keeps an execution-frame stack for `main`, `source`, and shell-function calls and derives Bash namespaced state such as `BASH_SOURCE`, `BASH_LINENO`, `BASH_EXECUTION_STRING`, `FUNCNAME`, and `caller` from that stack only for variants that expose the Bash namespace
- shell vars, `BASH_HISTORY`, and `VSH_UMASK` are synchronized through direct runner mutation APIs rather than bootstrap `eval` calls
- redirect compatibility work must not implicitly expand the product contract for background execution: job control remains unsupported, and this runtime does not promise separate asynchronous redirect-restoration semantics for `cmd &`

### 9.3 Stdio

Runner stdio is wired to bounded buffers owned by `internal/runtime/`. This gives us:

- deterministic capture for agent frameworks
- policy-controlled output limits
- no direct dependency on host terminal behavior

### 9.4 File handlers

The shell-core file handlers bridge the in-tree parser and interpreter into the project filesystem.

Responsibilities:

- resolve shell-relative paths against virtual `PWD`
- normalize paths using POSIX semantics
- enforce policy before touching the backend
- emit file access trace events when tracing is enabled
- call the selected `fs.FileSystem` backend

### 9.5 Call interception

The runner call handler runs for every simple command, including builtins and functions. We use it for:

- recording expanded argv after shell expansion
- enforcing builtin allow/deny policy
- enforcing the per-execution command-count budget before dispatch
- optionally canonicalizing argv in future features

The call handler does not execute commands. It is a pre-execution interception point.

Implementation detail for the current runtime:

- the default `MaxCommandCount` is `10000` per execution
- the counter resets on each `Session.Exec` or `Runtime.Run`
- commands inside subshells and pipelines count toward the same execution budget
- loop iteration limits are enforced by AST instrumentation that prepends an internal guard command to loop bodies before execution
- command substitution depth and glob-operation budgets are enforced from the shell-core compile pipeline, and glob-operation counts accumulate across all parsed chunks in one execution
- request-level timeouts and caller cancellation are enforced via execution contexts and normalized into shell-style exit codes

### 9.6 Command execution

The runner exec handler is the command dispatch path for non-builtin, non-function calls.

Flow:

1. receive expanded argv from the shell interpreter
2. resolve `argv[0]` against virtual command paths from the current `PATH`, or against an explicit virtual path such as `/bin/ls`
3. if missing, write a shell-style error to stderr and return exit status `127`
4. if present, run the Go command implementation
5. convert command errors into shell exit status errors
6. emit start/finish trace events when tracing is enabled

This preserves shell syntax while keeping all execution inside Go.

User-visible command lookup rules for MVP:

- bare command names only resolve if the current `PATH` includes a virtual command stub for that name
- bare-name resolution is cached per shell session in a Bash-style hash table keyed by command name
- cached bare-name entries store the shell-visible path candidate, so relative PATH entries stay relative until invalidated
- `hash` exposes that table: `hash` prints it, `hash name ...` pre-resolves entries with zero hits, and `hash -r` clears it before optionally re-hashing any remaining names
- cached entries are invalidated only by `hash -r` or any reassignment/unset of `PATH`; otherwise the shell keeps using the cached path even if a different earlier PATH entry appears later
- changing `PATH` can intentionally disable bare-name resolution
- explicit virtual paths such as `/bin/ls` bypass `PATH`
- there is no direct registry fallback for user-visible commands

## 10. Filesystem Model

The filesystem abstraction is deliberately smaller than `os`:

- file open
- stat
- lstat
- readdir
- readlink
- realpath
- mkdir
- mkfifo
- remove
- rename
- working directory state

Important properties:

- paths use POSIX semantics internally
- the default backend is in-memory
- the default backend exposes a Unix-like virtual layout rooted at `/`
- the runtime may reserve a small synthetic namespace such as `/dev/null`, `/dev/urandom`, and `/dev/zero` above any backend so shell-visible device behavior stays consistent across in-memory and host-backed filesystems
- host-backed filesystems must still satisfy policy checks and must never imply host command execution
- a read-write host-backed filesystem may be enabled explicitly for external test harnesses or advanced embedding, but it is not the default runtime backend
- host-backed filesystem mutations that create entries, including named pipes, must perform the final host operation relative to a resolved sandbox-confined directory handle rather than reusing a post-check absolute host path
- shell redirects and command file access share the same filesystem view
- symlink support is optional and must default to the safer behavior when policy is ambiguous
- for backends without symlink creation/traversal support, `Lstat` behaves like `Stat`, `Readlink` fails for non-symlinks, and `Realpath` resolves only existing virtual paths

The abstraction should remain narrow, but it must be allowed to grow where agent workflows clearly require it.

Implementation detail for the current runtime:

- `Lstat`, `Readlink`, and `Realpath` are now part of the core interface because path introspection is needed for future agent commands and safer path handling
- command-facing copy semantics stay in `commands/`, where policy and shell-facing errors already live
- `mkfifo` is a shipped registry command, so the filesystem interface exposes named-pipe creation directly and `MemoryFS` can persist FIFO entries alongside regular files and symlinks
- `fs/` may use private clone helpers internally for backend composition, but that is not the same as moving user-visible `cp` semantics into the filesystem layer
- the runtime wraps the configured backend with a tiny virtual-device layer; today that layer reserves `/dev`, `/dev/null`, `/dev/urandom`, and `/dev/zero`, while non-reserved `/dev/*` entries still come from the underlying sandbox filesystem when present
- `MemoryFS` stores symlink entries directly for testing and path-safety enforcement, but the runtime still defaults to `SymlinkDeny`
- `MemoryFS.Stat`, `Open`, `ReadDir`, `Chdir`, and `Realpath` follow symlinks; `Lstat`, `Readlink`, `Remove`, and `Rename` operate on the symlink entry itself
- `MemoryFS` may also hold lazy regular-file providers that materialize on first content-sensitive access such as `Open`, `Stat`, `Lstat`, or `DirEntry.Info`

Current and planned backends:

- `MemoryFS`: default mutable sandbox
- `SeededMemory`: in-memory factory seeded with eager or lazy per-path files for a fresh session
- `TrieFS`: experimental read-optimized in-memory backend that stores a path-segment trie with separate dentries and inodes; intended for static or read-mostly trees, mounted datasets, and shared lower layers
- `HostFS`: read-only host-backed directory view mounted at a configurable virtual root with sanitized errors and a backend-local regular-file read cap
- `ReadWriteFS`: mutable host-backed directory view rooted at `/` with sanitized errors and a backend-local regular-file read cap for opt-in host-backed workflows
- `OverlayFS`: copy-on-write backend with a read-only lower layer, writable in-memory upper layer, merged `readdir`, and tombstones for deletions
- `MountableFS`: multi-mount namespace over a base filesystem plus sibling mount points, with synthetic parent directories and path routing handled inside the backend
- `SnapshotFS`: deterministic read-only clone of another filesystem for tests and replay fixtures

Backend boundary for the current implementation:

- `vsh.Config.FileSystem` is the public setup boundary for session storage and starting directory; callers should not have to coordinate separate runtime knobs to mount a backend and choose the initial working directory
- `SeededMemory` and `vsh.SeededInMemoryFileSystem(...)` are the productized seed path for eager or lazy per-file session bootstrap
- `TrieFS` is an opt-in experimental backend exposed through `gbfs.Trie()` and `gbfs.SeededTrie(...)`
- the preferred shared-lower composition for read-mostly trie data is `gbfs.Reusable(gbfs.SeededTrie(...))`
- `TrieFS` is intended for static or read-mostly in-memory data and mounted datasets; it is not the default `runtime` session backend and is not the recommended path for `WithWorkspace`, `HostDirectoryFileSystem(...)`, or other live host-backed filesystem flows
- `HostFS` is an opt-in lower-layer backend exposed through `gbfs.Host(...)`; it is intended to sit underneath `gbfs.Overlay(...)`, not to replace the default in-memory runtime path
- `ReadWriteFS` is an opt-in mutable backend exposed through `gbfs.ReadWrite(...)`; it is intended for developer tooling, external test harnesses, and embedders that explicitly want host mutations
- `OverlayFS` is intended for internal session use and is exposed through `gbfs.Overlay(...)`
- `MountableFS` is an opt-in namespace backend exposed through `gbfs.Mountable(...)` and `vsh.MountableFileSystem(...)`; live `mount` and `unmount` behavior remains a concrete-backend capability rather than part of the core filesystem interface
- `SnapshotFS` is a read-only backend for deterministic fixtures and direct tests
- `SnapshotFS` is not the default `runtime` session backend because session bootstrap still creates the sandbox layout and command stubs
- the common host-project workflow should be represented as a high-level runtime helper that mounts a read-only host tree under an in-memory overlay and starts the session in that mounted directory
- the `@ewhauser/vsh-wasm` bridge should expose the same seeded-memory model for `files`, including lazy per-path providers, rather than eagerly writing every file after session creation

## 12. Policy Model

Policy is evaluated in-process and is mandatory.

Initial policy surface:

- allowed command set
- allowed builtin set
- allowed read roots
- allowed write roots
- stdout/stderr byte limits
- maximum file size
- maximum commands per execution
- maximum loop iterations
- maximum command substitution depth
- maximum glob operations
- symlink policy
- cancellation and timeout handling
- network disabled unless a sandboxed network client is explicitly configured

Default policy stance for MVP:

- command allowlist derived from the registered command set
- builtin allowlist permissive for core shell features
- reads and writes allowed inside `/`
- maximum command count defaults to `10000` per execution
- maximum loop iterations default to `10000` per loop
- maximum command substitution depth defaults to `50` per execution
- maximum glob operations default to `100000` per execution
- symlink traversal denied unless a filesystem backend and policy explicitly allow it
- request-level timeout is opt-in, but when it fires the execution must stop with exit code `124`
- caller-driven cancellation must stop the execution with exit code `130`
- no ambient network access; `curl` is absent unless the runtime enables the sandboxed network client

The policy package should be able to answer three questions:

1. may this command run?
2. may this builtin run?
3. may this path be read or written?

Network policy for the current runtime is enforced by the dedicated `network/` layer rather than by generic shell evaluation. Commands never receive host `http.Client` access directly; they only receive the runtime-owned sandboxed `network.Client`. The default sandboxed HTTP client must not inherit host proxy environment variables, and private-range blocking must be enforced during the actual dial using the same resolver surface used by the preflight URL check.

Path-policy enforcement rule for the current runtime:

- the lexical path the user asked for is checked first
- if the backend resolves that path through a symlink, the resolved target path is checked before backend access
- in `SymlinkDeny` mode, any attempted traversal through a symlink fails even if both lexical and resolved paths would otherwise be allowed

## 13. Trace Model

Tracing is opt-in at the runtime boundary.

When enabled, each execution should emit structured events such as:

- command argv after expansion
- command start and finish
- command resolution source
- file read/open/stat/readdir
- file write/create/remove/rename
- policy denials
- working directory
- timestamps and durations
- exit code
- session identifier and execution identifier

Tracing should be useful both for debugging and for building higher-level agent tooling. The event model should favor stable, structured fields over log-style strings.

The root runtime also exposes top-level logging callbacks for `exec.start`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `exec.finish`, and `exec.error`. Logging is callback-only and does not add new fields to `ExecutionResult`.

Implementation detail for the current runtime:

- the schema is project-owned and versioned as `vsh.trace.v1`
- the core runtime does not adopt OpenTelemetry as its event schema or transport contract
- tracing is disabled by default; `ExecutionResult.Events` is empty unless the embedder enables tracing
- `TraceRedacted` is the recommended default and redacts secret-bearing argv values before events are returned or emitted
- `TraceRaw` preserves full argv and path metadata and is unsafe unless the embedder controls sinks and retention
- interactive executions only emit trace callbacks; they do not return events
- every event carries `session_id` and `execution_id`
- redacted events set `redacted=true`
- command events carry `resolved_name`, `resolved_path`, and `resolution_source`
- path-policy and command-policy failures emit explicit `policy.denied` events
- file mutations emit `file.mutation` events alongside lower-level file access events when useful
- the trace schema should grow by additive fields and new event kinds rather than by overloading free-form messages

## 14. Error Handling

Errors fall into four categories:

1. parse errors
2. policy denials
3. command-level execution failures
4. internal runtime errors
