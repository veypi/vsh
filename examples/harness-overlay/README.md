# Harness Overlay

This example pins [`wedow/harness`](https://github.com/wedow/harness) in [`UPSTREAM_COMMIT`](./UPSTREAM_COMMIT), clones that ref into a gitignored cache, stages a runnable workspace there, and then starts a persistent `vsh` shell around it.

The repository does not check in any Harness runtime files or local Harness overlays. [`update-harness.sh`](./update-harness.sh) stages the pinned upstream runtime into `.cache/`, and the example runs that unmodified upstream workspace inside a persistent `vsh` session.

The pinned upstream revision is recorded in [`UPSTREAM_COMMIT`](./UPSTREAM_COMMIT) and [`PROVENANCE.md`](./PROVENANCE.md).

## Run

From the repository root:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
cd examples
GOWORK=off go run ./harness-overlay
```

Run a one-shot shell snippet inside the prepared harness workspace:

```bash
HARNESS_OVERLAY_WORKSPACE="$(./examples/harness-overlay/update-harness.sh)" \
  go run ./examples/harness-overlay --script './bin/harness help'
```

`go run ./examples/harness-overlay` by itself only works when `HARNESS_OVERLAY_WORKSPACE` already points at a prepared cache workspace.

Inside the interactive shell, run harness directly:

```bash
./bin/harness
./bin/harness "summarize this tree"
./bin/harness tools
```

## Notes

- `update-harness.sh` clones the pinned upstream ref into `examples/harness-overlay/.cache/` and stages a runnable workspace there before the example starts.
- The prepared workspace is mounted read-only at `/home/agent/project` with an in-memory writable overlay, so harness state lives only for the lifetime of the example process.
- The example runs upstream Harness as-is. Files written by tool calls persist for the lifetime of the outer `vsh` session because the sandbox filesystem overlay persists, but Harness keeps its normal upstream per-tool shell process semantics.
- API-key providers and the bundled compatible variants are supported in v1. Local private OpenAI-compatible endpoints and the ChatGPT OAuth login flow are intentionally out of scope for this example.
